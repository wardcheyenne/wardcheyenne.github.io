<u><b>1. Predicting Reversals In Earth's Axial Dipole</b></u>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>Every million years or so Earth experiences a reversal of the magnetic North and South
poles. This phenomenon last occurred roughly 780,000 years ago and we are steadily approaching
another reversal. Although the cause of Earth’s axial dipole reversal remains unknown, it would prove
great significance if we can predict when another one might occur.</p>
<b>Methods</b> 
<p> Using data that scientists have gathered on past reversals that have occurred, we will derive a
mathematical, differential equation model of the phenomenon of reversals of Earth’s axial dipole. From
here we can create a computer simulation using Matlab or Python.</p>
<b>Significance</b> 
<p>Reversals of Earth’s magnetic field are important to understand the evolution of our planet on geological
time scales (millions of years). Moreover, understanding the magnetic field allows us to draw inferences
about the fluid dynamics that occur at Earth’s liquid core, which is inaccessible for direct measurement.
The magnetic field, and it’s record over the past millions of years, are indeed the only tool we have to
understand Earth’s liquid core and in particular the mechanisms that lead the liquid core initiate a
magnetic reversal. This tool will allow earth scientists to better identify possible causes of a reversal given
the timeframe that it is predicted to occur.</p>
